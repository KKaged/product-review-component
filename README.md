## Overview

Just a simple product page for a Chanel Perfume.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Links

- Live Site URL: [My live site](https://kkaged.github.io/product-review-component/)

## My process

First I started by creating the main container and slowly built everything one at a time. Once everything was added, I began to style it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The most important thing that I learned from this was to place everything differently depending on the screen size. The image for the mobile version was the most difficult thing. "object-fit: cover;" was that saved me.
